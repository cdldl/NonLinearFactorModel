# NonLinearFactorModel


Run with python3.6


Potential Improvements
Use sqrt(volume) as proxy for market capitalization for benchmark
TS Factor standardization
Garch Return Standardization
AutoML Cross-CV for predictions
Rocket: Weighted by probabilities instead of prediction weighted 
Autoencoder: if number of variables was many
Compare to Benchmark
Parallelize the program
Use numba for functions
Modularize
