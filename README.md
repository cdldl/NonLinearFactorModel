######
# Potential Improvements
# Use sqrt(volume) as proxy for market capitalization for benchmark
# TS Factor standardization
# Garch Return Standardization
# AutoML Cross-CV for predictions
# Rocket: Weighted by probabilities instead of prediction weighted 
# Autoencoder: if number of variables was many
# Compare to Benchmark
# Parallelize the program
# Use numba for functions
# Modularize
# Requirements.txt file
